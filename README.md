# species-extinction_RN
Rondi's RIOS project on species extinction

Project Overview
-   This project follows Ed Tekwa's research published in PNAS (insert link or citation) which found that there are certain stable states where more species persist and state where species are more likely to go extinct. This was found by comapring cost/price ratios and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The objective was to see if the trends from previos research hold up, to establish a database that can be used for future studies, and to establish a method of assessing the compiled data. In the future, the findings from this project as well as projects based on this database will be used alongside statisitical models to predict species extinction risk.

DATA_ANALYSIS.R
-   This file is where all the data analysis was done. There was a lot of trial and error in the process, so the plots and necessary code were moved to the top, past the "Useful Plots and objects" section it's mostly not useful except to see my learning progress and notes as I troubleshooted. The data used for this came from (upload the excel and csv files to reference here).
